# Contactbookmanagement
This Python program handles contacts and offers a number of possibilities: adding, viewing, searching, changing or deleting a contactâ€™s details such as names, phone numbers, e-mails and addresses. In order to save contact information between sessions, the contacts are saved in a JSON file (contacts.json).
